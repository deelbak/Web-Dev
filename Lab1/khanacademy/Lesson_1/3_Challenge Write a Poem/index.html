        <h1>A Lover's Complaint</h1>
        <p>FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded</p>
        <p>A plaintful story from a sistering vale,</p>
        <p>My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,</p>
        <p>And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;</p>
        <p>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,</p>
        <p>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</p>
        <p>Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.</p>
